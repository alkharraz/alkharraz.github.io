Love inspired many works of literature, art, and music. Love gave us the best days in our lives.  You may hear about how romantic love is a social constructed and invented by the French troubadours of the 12th century with their stories about moral and social code, their idealization of women.


There are to kind of love: passionate and compassionate. Passionate love is “wildly emotional state in which tender and sexual feelings, elation and pain, anxiety and relief, altruism and jealousy coexist in a confusion of feelings.” It makes you want union with your loved one. This kind of feeling (passionate love) is drug and it’s symptoms are like heroin and cocaine-releasing dopamine. No drug can keep you high, It has to to wear off eventually, because the brain develops neuro chemical reactions that opposes the dopamine.



On the other side compassionate love is “the affection we feel for those with whom our lives are deeply intertwined.” Compassionate love, in contrast with passionate love, grows slowly. As the lovers build their trust and attachments to each other. This kind of love is the one your looking for. As time goes the heat of compassionate love doesn’t cool down dramatically and die.



If we compare these two loves, we can see that passionate love may die within months or even days in some cases. Compassionate love on the other hand is long lasting, it may last a lifetime.
